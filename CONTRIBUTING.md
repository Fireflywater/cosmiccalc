## How to contribute

### Getting Started
If you are familiar with Github, you may skip this section.

#### Glossary
- **Repository**: A _repository_ contains all of the project files, information, documentations, and also each file's revision history. Simply imagine it as the project's folder.
- **Fork**: A personal copy of a repository. You can freely make changes to your own _fork_ without affecting the main repository.
- **Commit**: A _commit_ is an individual change made to a file (or a set of files). It is similar to saving a file, but instead of just saving, Git creates a unique ID to help you keep track of each "revision" of the project.
- **Pull Request**: To submit the changes (or to be precise, _commits_) you've made on your fork to the main repository, you create a _Pull Request_. This shows us the difference between your fork and the main repository.
- **Merge**: Once your pull request is approved, changes made in your fork will be _merged_ into the main repository.
